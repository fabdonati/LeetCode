# Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

# Example:

# Input:  [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]
# Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

# Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

# Follow up:
# Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        length = len(nums)

        L, R, answer = [0]*length, [0]*length, [0]*length

        L[0] = 1
        R[length-1] = 1

        for i in range(1, length):
          L[i] = nums[i-1]*L[i-1]
        for i in reversed(range(length-1)):
          R[i] = nums[i+1]*R[i+1]

        for i in range(length):
          answer[i] = L[i]*R[i]
          
        return answer
